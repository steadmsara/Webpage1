<h1> Welcome! </h1>
<h3> My name is Sara </h3>
<p> I am a fourth year college student, but a second year transfer at Columbia College Chicago. I am currently an Interior Architecture major, but I am finding that I want to switch my major out to graphic design. I design websites for my current job, but I do not know the coding aspect. I am hoping that I can learn a few new coding skills with this course!</p>
<p> I love all things art, I do graphic design, I love fashion, and I love to decorate interior spaces. I enjoy reading good books, doing my makeup, and I love cats.</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qap5aO4i9A"> I like to listen to this when I study :) </a>
<h4> Here's one of my cats... his name is Tucker and he likes to climb trees :) </h4>
