<h1> Welcome! </h1>
<h3> My name is Sara </h3>
<p> I am a fourth year college student, but a second year transfer at Columbia College Chicago! I am currently an Interior Architecture major, but I am finding that I want to switch my major out to graphic design! I design websites for my current job, but I do not know the coding aspect. I am hoping that I can learn a few new coding skills with this course!<p>
<p> I love all things art, i do graphic design, I love fashion, and I love to decorate interior spaces. I enjoy reading good books, doing my makeup, and I love cats.<p>
<h3> Here's one of my cats... his name is Tucker and he likes to climb trees :) </h3>
